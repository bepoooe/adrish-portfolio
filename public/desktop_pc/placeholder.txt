This directory needs to contain a 3D model of a computer in GLTF format.

You'll need to place a file named 'scene.gltf' here, along with any associated textures or assets that the model requires.

You can download a computer 3D model from sources like:
1. https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/categories/electronics/pc
2. https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/computer/gltf
3. https://market.pmnd.rs/

Make sure to get a model with proper licensing for your usage.
