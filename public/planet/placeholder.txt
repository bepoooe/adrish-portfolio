This directory needs to contain a 3D model of Earth in GLTF format.

You'll need to place a file named 'scene.gltf' here, along with any associated textures or assets that the model requires.

You can download Earth 3D models from sources like:
1. https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/earth
2. https://market.pmnd.rs/
3. https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/earth/gltf

Make sure to get a model with proper licensing for your usage.
